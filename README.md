Guess the number game is a simple game where the player tries to guess a random number that has been generated by the computer or another player. The game can be played with any range of numbers, but it is typically played with numbers between 1 and 20.

The rules of the game are simple. The player is given a certain number of guesses to correctly guess the randomly generated number. After each guess, the game will provide feedback to the player, letting them know if their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the number, or they run out of guesses.

To make the game more challenging, some variations may include limiting the number of guesses the player has or increasing the range of possible numbers.

Guess the number game can be played as a standalone game, or it can be incorporated into other games, such as escape rooms or treasure hunts. It is a fun and easy game to play, and it can be played by people of all ages.
